Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
a C++ compiler, and the libraries: zlib, libdatrie, libdivsufsort, sdsl, 
and MultiFast (Aho-Corasick automaton).

For Ubuntu Linux, make sure your are on-line, and install the above via

Basic Instructions
==================

   Make sure you have uncommented the analogous function of the library
you would like to test in file `example.cc'. The shell command `make' 
should compile this example program. 

After compilation the binary `example' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./example ./data/text0 ./data/pattern0 0

 $ ./example ./data/text1 ./data/pattern1 1

 $ ./example ./data/text2 ./data/pattern2 2

 $ ./example ./data/text3 ./data/pattern2 3
